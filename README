				 INTRODUCTION

This is release 1.44 of QobiScheme.  It is the underlying substrate for most of
the Scheme software that is produced by me and my students.  Before you
install QobiScheme you must first install Infrastructure, which you can obtain
by anonymous FTP from
ftp://dynamo.ecn.purdue.edu/pub/qobi/infrastructure.tar.Z.
This release of QobiScheme requires version 1.27 of Infrastructure, or better.

				 INSTALLATION

To compile QobiScheme, first unpack the distribution:

% uncompress QobiScheme-1.44.tar.Z
% tar xvf QobiScheme-1.44.tar
% rm QobiScheme-1.44.tar
% cd QobiScheme-1.44/source

The makefile for QobiScheme is distributed with architecture-specific
variables for the several architectures.  Before compiling, you should do:

% architecture-path

and check to see that there is an entry in the makefile for that architecture.
If not, edit the makefile to add an entry for your architecture.  Since
architecture names are specific to a particular machine level and OS version,
you can often copy an existing entry and just change the name.  For example,
an entry for i586-Linux-2.0.29 is likely to be identical to one for
i686-Linux-2.0.27.

Then do the following:

% make port
% cd `architecture-path`
% make install

The above can be repeated for as many architectures as you wish to support.

				 PORTABILITY

QobiScheme has been tested only under Solaris 1.1.3, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6 on
Sun/SPARCs, Linux 2.0.0, 2.0.18, 2.0.27, 2.0.30, 2.0.32, 2.0.33, 2.0.34,
2.0.35, and 2.2.1 on Intel/x86s, FreeBSD 2.2-STABLE on Intel/x86s, Linux
2.0.35 and OSF/1 V3.2 and V4.0 on DEC/Alphas, and Irix 4.0.5, 5.3, and 6.2 on
SGI/MIPSs, though it may work under other operating systems on other platforms.

			       ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Thanks to James Rootham for contributing the CPU time procedures.  Thanks to
Richard Mann for contributing the API to C arrays and OpenGL.  Thanks to Marc
Feeley for giving me access to an Alpha running OSF/1 and to the Computer
Science Department at Rice University for giving me access to a Pentium Pro
running FreeBSD to produce those ports.
